## 📌 Project Overview

**Audio Transmission using Light Fidelity (Li-Fi)** is a hardware-based wireless communication project that demonstrates how **audio signals can be transmitted using visible light instead of radio waves**.  

In this system, an audio signal from a mobile device is amplified and used to modulate an LED. The modulated light carries the audio information and is received by a solar panel, which converts it back into an electrical signal and plays it through a speaker.

This project highlights the feasibility of **Li-Fi as a secure, RF-free alternative** for short-range audio communication.
